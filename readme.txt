CaptchaFox is an easy-to-use and GDPR compliant bot protection service. Protect your WordPess forms from malicious bot traffic!

== Description ==

CaptchaFox defends and safeguards your website against automated attacks such as account takeover, spam, scalping, and web scraping, while adhering to EU data protection regulations.

It utilizes a variety of data signals and challenges to verify the authenticity of the user without the use of cookies or trackers.
The challenges have low friction and are easily solvable for humans, but difficult for bots. With the one-click challenge, legitimate users don't even know they're being challenged.

This plugin comes with out-of-the-box support for popular form plugins, such as Contact Forms 7, WPForms, Woocommerce, Mailchimp, and more. Therefore, no developer experience is required.
